## 🛠 Development & Editing

There are multiple ways to work with this codebase.

### Option 1: Edit Using Lovable

I used **Lovable** for rapid UI iteration and layout refinement.

* Open the project:
  [https://lovable.dev/projects/REPLACE_WITH_PROJECT_ID](https://lovable.dev/projects/6c9a1f3b-2d0b-4185-a235-5eebb3a2cf1e)
* Changes made through Lovable are **automatically committed** to this repository.
* Useful for quick UI, layout, and component-level updates.

### Option 2: Run Locally (Recommended for Development)

#### Prerequisites

* Node.js
* npm
  (Recommended via `nvm`: [https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))

#### Steps

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Navigate to the project directory
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

This will start a local development server with hot reloading and instant preview.

### Option 3: Edit Directly on GitHub

For small or quick edits:

* Open the file you want to edit
* Click the **Edit (✏️)** button
* Commit changes directly from GitHub

---

### Option 4: GitHub Codespaces

You can also develop entirely in the browser:

* Click **Code → Codespaces**
* Create a new Codespace
* Edit, commit, and push changes without local setup
